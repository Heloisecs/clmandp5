# clmtrackr and P5


This is a web interaction created with clmtrackr and p5 for projection on an installation.

It maps user face from the feed of the webcam and shows different layers of photographs depending on how the person moves.

If the person moves out of the front of the cam, program randomly changes the pictures for the next person.

Right now, if you run this in local server the feed of the cam is very small, so not so good for an actual web app, but changing canvas size this can be modified.
